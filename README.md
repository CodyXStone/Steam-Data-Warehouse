This repository captures my progression into data analytics—from earning my SQL certification to developing interactive Power BI dashboards as part of my PL‑300 preparation. It features projects that reflect technical growth, hands‑on problem‑solving, and a growing ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Repository Structure
  Scripts folder: Contains the SQL queries used to clean, transform, and explore data from the Steam database.

  PowerBI_reports folder: Includes screenshots of dashboards built from the dataset. These visualizations address key industry questions, such as which platforms dominate the market and which          publishers consistently produce top‑performing games.
